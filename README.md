# NQB Draft

This repo contains the master XML version of the NQB PHB draft.  The xml can be used to generate various human-readable versions via the [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org) tool.

In addition, if you have xml2rfc installed on your system, you can use the include Makefile to build the html and txt versions.
